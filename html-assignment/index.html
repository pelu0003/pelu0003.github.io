                About me
            </h2>

            <p>
                Hello, my name is Nicolas Peluso. I am 33 years old and I came from Argentina, the country of <br> 
                <em>Tango</em>, which I do not listen to that much, <em>Football Soccer</em>, the best sport in the world that is actually played with the foot <br>
                and <em>“Asado”</em>, which is an Argentinian barbecue I am really missing right now, as well as a proper <em>“Dulce de leche”</em>,<br>
                which is the Argentinian Nutella. 
             </p>

             <p>
                When I was in my country, I got a bachelor’s degree in Advertising in June 30 <sup>th</sup> 2016 from <abbr title="Universidad Nacional de Lomas de Zamora"> UNLZ </abbr>, and I have been working in that field <br>
                since then, specially in the creative area. So that is what I enjoy the most in a job, the opportunity to do creative things.<br> 
                I enjoy copywriting as well as designing. 
             </p>

             <p>
                My other great passion in life besides <em>River Plate</em>, a Soccer team from Argentina, is <em>music</em>.<br>
                I play the guitar and bass; I also would like to learn to play the piano.<br>
                 I enjoy writing my own songs and producing my own music.<br>
             </p>

            <h2>
                My motivational quote 
            </h2>
            <blockquote>
                The show must go on <br>
                The show must go on, yeah <br>
                Inside my heart is breaking <br>
                My makeup may be flaking <br>
                But my smile, still, stays on <br>
